A multi-tenant git server using NodeJS.

Read the [Documented Source Code Here](http://qrpike.github.io/NodeJS-Git-Server/host.coffee.html)

Made to be able to support many git repo's and users with Read/Write customizable permissions.


# Install Git Server

To install the git server run:

	npm install git-server

To run tests

	git clone https://github.com/qrpike/NodeJS-Git-Server.git
	cd ./NodeJS-Git-Server
	make test


# Example Usage

The GitServer is a very easy to get up and running git server. It uses the [Pushover](https://github.com/substack/pushover) and [git-emit](https://github.com/substack/node-git-emit) modules for listening to git events, and its own layer to do the security for each repo & user.

```javascript
	var GitServer = require('git-server');
	var newUser = {
		username:'demo',
		password:'demo'
	}
	var newRepo = {
		name:'myrepo',
		anonRead:false,
		users: [
			{ user:newUser, permissions:['R','W'] }
		]
	}
	server = new GitServer([ newRepo ]);
```

# Events:

Server object emits these events:

##passive events

These events are informational only. They can not be aborted.

* post-applypatch
* post-commit
* post-checkout
* post-merge
* post-receive
* post-update
* post-rewrite

##abortable events

These events can be aborted or accepted. If there will be no listeners for any of these events, they will be automatically accepted. If object can be aborted, it will have canAbort property in update argument.

* fetch
* commit
* applypatch-msg
* pre-applypatch
* pre-commit
* prepare-commit-msg
* commit-msg
* pre-rebase
* pre-receive
* update
* pre-auto-gc

```javascript
	var GitServer = require('git-server');
	var newUser = {
		username:'demo',
		password:'demo'
	}
	var newRepo = {
		name:'myrepo',
		anonRead:false,
		users: [
			{ user:newUser, permissions:['R','W'] }
		]
	}
	server = new GitServer([ newRepo ]);
	server.on('commit', function(update, repo) {
		// do some logging or other stuff
		update.accept() //accept the update.
	});
	server.on('post-update', function(update, repo) {
		//do some deploy stuff
	});
```

When we start the git server, it will default to port 7000. We can test this using git on this (or another ) machine.

```
	git clone http://localhost:7000/myrepo.git
```

Since this repo does *NOT* allow anonymous reading, it will prompt us for a user/pass

To make this faster, we can use the basic auth structure:

	git clone http://demo:demo@localhost:7000/myrepo.git

This should not prompt you for any user/pass. Also in the future when you push changes, or pull, it will not ask you for this info again.

## Repo object

Repo object is the object passed to start the server plus some additional methods and properties.

```javascript
{
  name: 'stackdot',
  anonRead: false,
  users: [ { user: {username: "demo", password: "demo"}, permissions: ["R", "W"] } ],
  path: '/tmp/repos/stackdot.git',
  last_commit: {
  	status: 'pending',
  	repo: 'anon.git',
  	service: 'receive-pack',
  	cwd: '/tmp/repos/stackdot.git',
  	last: '00960000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  	commit: '67359bb4a6cddd97b59507413542e0b08ef078b0',
  	evName: 'push',
  	branch: 'master'
  }
}
```

## Update object

`update` is an http duplex object (see below) with these extra properties:

```javascript
{
  cwd: '/tmp/repos/stackdot.git', // Current repo dir
  repo: 'stackdot.git', // Repo name
  accept: [Function], // Method to accept request (if aplicable)
  reject: [Function], // Method to reject request (if aplicable)
  exists: true, // Does the repo exist
  name: 'fetch', // Event name
  canAbort: true // If event can be abbortable
}
```

# HTTPS

The ability to use HTTPS is now implemented for the module and the cli. This is important so that your username & password is encrypted when being sent over the wire. If you are not using username/password then you may want to disregard this section.

To enable HTTPS in the module, use the 'cert' param:

```javascript
	var fs = require('fs');
	var certs = {
		key		: fs.readFileSync('../certs/privatekey.pem')
		cert	: fs.readFileSync('../certs/certificate.pem')
	};
	_g = new GitServer([ newRepo ], undefined, undefined, undefined, certs);
```

To enable HTTPS in the cli, use the '--ssl' option along with '--key' and '--cert' options:

	git-server[|gitserver] --ssl --key ../certs/privatekey.pem --cert ../certs/certificate.pem

To create these certs you can run:

	openssl genrsa -out privatekey.pem 1024
	openssl req -new -key privatekey.pem -out certrequest.csr
	openssl x509 -req -in certrequest.csr -signkey privatekey.pem -out certificate.pem

Also, be aware that when using HTTPS for the git server, when you try to clone,etc. It will give you an SSL error because git (which uses CURL) cannot verify the SSL Cert. To correct this, install a actual, verified SSL Cert ( Free ones here: [StartCom](http://www.startssl.com/?app=1) )

If you want to keep using the self signed cert like we created above ^ just tell git to not verify the cert. ( Other ways to do it [here](http://www.f15ijp.com/2012/08/git-ssl-certificate-problem-how-to-turn-off-ssl-validation-for-a-repo/) )

	export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true

And you are good to go!

# CLI Usage


When you install this package globally using

```
	sudo npm install -g git-server
```

You will now have a CLI interface you can run and interact with.

Get started by typing `git-server` or `gitserver` into your terminal.

You should see something similar to this:
![image](https://raw.github.com/qrpike/NodeJS-Git-Server/master/cli-screenshot.png)

With this interface you can type the following to see the available commands:

	git-server> help

You will see a list of possible commands, just enter a command and the prompt will ask you for any additional details needed.

# TODO Items

- Make YouTube demo of the app
